# Witching Hour: A Choose Your Own Adventure Game by Rob Bock
#### *Adapted from "Choose Your Own Adventure: Witching Hour", a comedic Powerpoint Presentation by Mike Bock*

## Introduction

A few things about me that you may or may not be aware of:

- I have a twin brother who is a comedian and creates and presents comedic Powerpoint presentations to live audiences
- I like these presentations and have long been considering adapting them as Javascript-based web projects
- Recently I decided to actually do this and adapt my favorite presentation, "Witching Hour"

... The result is linked above! 

Overall the code is pretty simple — it's just 1 file each of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no libraries, frameworks, etc. — and it took me about a day to put together. I really just wanted to get this project online and into my portfolio in time for Daylight Savings Time (which is thematically relevant to the story), so I'm glad I was able to finish it in time!

I'd say it works as a 'proof of concept', but I do intend to recreate this as an actual full-stack web app with better performance, new features, etc. in the near future.


## Features

Users can click buttons to navigate through a Choose Your Own Adventure-style game. The game blends text descriptions, images, and sound effects to  create an interactive storytelling experience. The game contains 94 'slides' of game data, and takes about 5 minutes to click through.


## Technolgies I Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Deployed on GitHub Pages


## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun making this, and I think it works as a direct adaption of the source material. I'm looking forward to fleshing it out in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more updates coming soon!
