# Witching Hour: A Choose Your Own Adventure Game by Rob Bock
#### Adapted from "Choose Your Own Adventure: Witching Hour", a comedic Powerpoint Presentation by Mike Bock

## Introduction

A few things about me that you may or may not be aware of:

- I have a twin brother who is a comedian and creates and presents comedic Powerpoint presentations to live audiences
- I like these presentations and have long been considering adapting them as web projects
- Recently I decided to actually make this happen and adapt my favorite presentation, "Witching Hour"

... The result is linked above! 

Overall the project is pretty simple -- it's just 1 file each of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no libraries, frameworks, etc., and it took me about a day to put together.  But I wanted to get this project online and into my portfolio in time for Daylight Savings Time (which was two days ago), so I'm glad I was able to make that happen.

I think it works as sort of a 'proof of concept', but I do intend to recreate it as an actual full-stack web app with better performance, new features, etc. So, stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks!

## Features

Users can click buttons to navigate through a Choose Your Own Adventure-style game. The game blends text descriptions, images, and sound effects to  create an interactive storytelling experience. The game contains 94 'slides' of story, and takes about 5 minutes to click through.


## Technolgies I Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Deployed on GitHub Pages

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun making this, and I think it works as a direct adaption of the source material. I'm looking forward to adding enhancements and improvements to make it work as a full-stack web app in the future!
